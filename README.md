# 🎬 Cinematic Portfolio - Full-Stack Developer

A high-performance, motion-focused portfolio website featuring cinematic transitions, liquid cursor effects, and WebGL-inspired animations.

**Live Demo:** [https://pratik7897.github.io/portfolio/](https://pratik7897.github.io/portfolio/)

## 🚀 The Tech Stack

This project was built without heavy frameworks to ensure maximum performance for complex animations:

* **Frontend Engine:** Vanilla JavaScript
* **Animation Core:** GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
* **Motion Plugins:** ScrollTrigger (for the "video-scrubbing" feel)
* **Styling:** Custom CSS3 with Anamorphic Lens effects

---

## 🧪 Engineering Highlights

### 1. The "Camera Zoom" Intro
Using **GSAP ScrollTrigger**, I mapped the scroll progress to a scale-and-blur transform on the hero text. This creates an immersive "zoom through" effect that replaces traditional vertical scrolling.

### 2. Ghost-Outline Glitch
To maintain visual hierarchy while using massive typography, I implemented a transparent `-webkit-text-stroke` with a custom CSS keyframe animation. This allows technical descriptions to be readable through the background titles.

### 3. Liquid Cursor & Parallax
The mouse follower uses a **lerp (Linear Interpolation)** logic via GSAP to create a lag effect, mimicking fluid movement. The project gallery uses container-linked parallax to move images and backgrounds at different speeds.
